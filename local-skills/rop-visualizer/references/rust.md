# Rust Result semantics for diagrams

| Source operation              | Railway meaning                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?` on `Result`               | Continue with Ok; Err returns from the enclosing function/closure. Inspect the `From` conversion to its return error type.  |
| `and_then`                    | Invoke the fallible callback only on Ok; Err bypasses it.                                                                   |
| `map`                         | Transform Ok; preserve Err.                                                                                                 |
| `map_err`                     | Transform Err without recovering.                                                                                           |
| `or_else`                     | Run the handler only for Err; its returned Result may succeed or fail. Read match arms to determine which variants recover. |
| `inspect`, `inspect_err`      | Observe the corresponding variant, preserving it. These callbacks do not provide a new Result error channel.                |
| `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else` | Produce a plain final value, ending the Result channel; lazy/eager fallback evaluation differs.                             |
| `unwrap`, `expect`            | Ok produces a value; Err can panic. Panic exits the ordinary Err lane.                                                      |

The enclosing scope is critical. In `let value = helper()?; later(value)`, failure
in helper returns before `later`. A later `.or_else(...)` on `later(value)` cannot
catch that earlier error. A caller wrapping the entire function's returned
Result can handle it. Keep those two handler scopes separate in the diagram.

Inspect `From` implementations and `#[from]` declarations. Label the conversion
when an error changes at `?`; do not invent a From mapping from type names alone.
An error-transforming helper is not a recovery helper just because it is called
"handle_error".

Read explicit `match`, early `return`, loops, async joins, and `Drop`/cleanup code
that affects the requested flow. A joined set of futures does not imply a serial
railway. If cleanup or an unavailable dependency cannot be characterized from
source, state that limit rather than adding fabricated success/error edges.
