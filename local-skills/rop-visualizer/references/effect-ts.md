# Effect semantics for diagrams

Check the project's installed Effect version and its actual imports. The mapping
below is for Effect v3; verify names against that version when they differ.

| Source operation                   | Railway meaning                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Effect.gen` / `yield*`, `flatMap` | Bind: typed failure skips the rest of that sequence until an enclosing handler or return.                                              |
| `map`                              | Transform only the success value; typed errors pass through.                                                                           |
| `mapError`, `mapBoth.onFailure`    | Transform the error value/type on the error lane; no recovery.                                                                         |
| `tap`                              | Preserve the original success value only when the tap succeeds. A fallible tap can fail the entire sequence.                           |
| `catchTag`                         | Handle a matching `_tag` within the wrapped effect's scope. Unmatched errors pass through; the handler's own failure remains possible. |
| `catchAll`                         | Handle typed errors in that scope. The fallback may itself fail.                                                                       |
| `try`, `tryPromise`                | Convert thrown/rejected values according to their configured error mapping.                                                            |

`Effect<A, E, R>` separates success A, typed error E, and required services R.
Requirements are dependencies, not failure branches. A declared union bounds
possible typed errors but does not establish which concrete path happens.

`die` and unexpected exceptions are defects; fiber interruption is another
runtime cause. Ordinary typed-error recovery is not a catch for all runtime
causes. Represent explicit relevant causes separately. `sandbox` exposes
`Cause<E>` in the error channel, and cause-aware handlers can change that boundary;
read those scopes before drawing an edge. Do not add hypothetical defect arrows
to every node merely because JavaScript could throw.

For `Effect.all` or validation combinators, inspect the actual options and
version. Independent effects are not necessarily sequential or parallel; show
the configured concurrency, failure accumulation, and join behavior. Retries,
resource scopes, and finalizers need explicit treatment when present—especially
cleanup that runs on failure.
